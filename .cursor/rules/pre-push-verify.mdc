# Pre-Push Verification

Before pushing changes, the build must pass. This project has:

1. **Husky pre-push hook** – Runs `npm run verify` automatically on `git push`. If the build fails, the push is blocked.
2. **Manual check** – You can run `npm run verify` anytime to confirm TypeScript and Vite build succeed.

When helping with commits or pushes:
- Do not skip or bypass the pre-push hook
- If the user reports build errors before push, fix them before pushing
- The verify script runs `npm run build` (tsc + vite build)
